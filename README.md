## Dictionary
# Overview
This is a test of the Dictionary. This should preform certain function to display the correct values to the console.

The First set should add two values to the Dictionary, 10 and 25, and display them.

The Second set should delete the second value, then add two values, both being 75, before displaying them.

The Third set should clear the Dictionary, then try and fail to remove a value with the Key of 'Value', before finally adding three values, -12, 0, and 12, before displaying them, while simultaneously removing the third value, but still diplaying the value it had.

The last set should just clear the dictionary again, then try to get the value with the Key of 'First', but fail and just display 0.
